124: max(0)
VERY CAREFUL, The current sub tree can always offer to return an None path
REVISIT

126, 127: BFS with metadata. 
special case, when begin=end and end not in dictionary.
target word is on the frontier, but not valid
126: REVISIT, good to keep cands as BFS frontier
keeps the mapping between upper level -> list of lower level nodes

128: one side union: UF loads once and union later. Can reuse union find for the set operations
set pop

129: none case inside function

140: stage 3, break one LL into two

141/142: rewrite, condition update to fp and fp.next != None and fp.next.next != None, will never
quit if there is loop there. Blindless move fp two step inside loop
Basic structure
        while fp and fp.next and fp.next.next:
            fp = fp.next.next
            sp = sp.next
            
            if sp == fp:
                meet = sp
                break

143: fp, sp, old approach of moving. 
sp, start of second half, first half size int(n/2)
Easier to take out the case when len(LL) < 2

Basic idea, break into two separate link list, n/2, n - n/2, and reverse the second,
merge two then. It is tricky if first half link list is empty. 

201: mask the last n digits to be zero
(num >> n) << n

another approach 
num & ~(1 << n - 1) 

202: flyod approach, break if reaches 1 or sp == fp

205: len(set(zip(s, t))) == len(set(s)) == len(set(t))
or double map/index map approach

207: DFS go inversely along dependency, ie, go from you to your prerequisite. This way 
topo sorting close with no prerequisite element first

Also link removal algorithm, keep degree of prerequisite and map of items depending on it.
Once remove the element, notify items depending on it to decrese their prerequisite degree
Note BFS does not need visited state, because only add once when the prereq count falls to zero.

BFS keeps dependency map (who depend on self) and pre-req count

227: operator stack, priority higher on top, lower priority pops higher
+/- pops */
REVISIT. In the end there may still be many operator and operands left. We need to pop them all

228: just a specific case of merge interval, each number n can be thought as [n, n]

229: keep two leading ballots. No need to rank between those two
I used //, but not necessary here. // means floor division, even for float. 
(/ is already doing floor division for integers)

230: inorder generator

231: bit oper, corner case of num=0

232: upside down function, if stack_pop is empty

233: revisit, math problem

236: single return, main.py still assume that p/q must be inside tree, only right solution
UPDATE: To make it easier to understand, return LCA and count, which is number of matches in subtree
main.py is the best solution. It can short circuit on left tree

239: non-increasing sequence for window

240: stair case new approach, can do linear

241: to parse
tokens = re.split("(\D)", input)
nums = map(int, tokens[::2])
ops = tokens[1::2]
Then takes index on nums as sub problems


307: lazy calling recursion. check rage inside function
li, hi to li, mid and mid, hi, stop at case when li + 1 = hi
return self.query_node(root.left, start, min(end, mid)) + self.query_node(root.right, max(start, mid), end)

BIT:
query just remove last bit 1, how about update
i += i & (-i) 
# i & (-i) return the larget 2 power which divides i


310: leave cuting algorithm until there is only one or two leaves left, return it

311: smart use of lazy loading and vector linear combination
REVISIT: A needs preprocessing, B just iterate. But A can be further optimized by lazy loading.
A columns maybe very full, but it may not needs reading at all. 

312: nums[k] * nums[i-1] * nums[j] for problem i,j k is the last one to pop in the interval. The boundary are guaranteed

314: sorting on x, left tree node may go underneath right tree node, so need depth to help sorting
BFS is better, REVISIT
inside same verticl, first sort by depth, then by left/right

315: Descending sorting is more natual, since all smaller elements are on the right.
UPDATE: desc or asc doesn't matter

316: beautiful greedy algorithm

317: multi-origin BFS span does not work here. If A appears in some level for multi-origin BFS. It only tells me
it is reachable to one of the origin, in this question, we need to know the distance to all origin.

So do span on origins one by one

318: revisit, group by mask multiply by maxlen, don't store each string

320: use iteration, don't use bitmap. Three cases

321: The merge is not very efficient. But seems OK

330: keep cap and greedy, cap += num, or put cap + 1 as new value if needed.
Outloop is cap

332: need to pop one ticket every time. sort visit smallest dictionary each time.
But sort reverse so pop from end

333: Revisit, clean way to write
use count = None ? to determine if child tree is valid

334: speical case

336: BF, but palin can be either prefix or suffix of string

340: stream processing for follow up, last index map
How to optmize on line 14, now we are sorting to get min
What we need is a map which can get the key with the smallest value
When update the value of key, we just remove the old <K,V> from treeset,
change the hashset mapping and re-insert into treeset.
Same as priority queue with updatable priority

# In Java we can do a HashMap<K, V> and TreeSet<Tuple<K, V>> TreeSet sorted by V first then K

341: Cool generator approach
or preorder stack
seekValue and seekNode, seekNode move the iterator pointer to the next available place.

342: return num > 0 and num&(num-1) == 0 and num&0x55555555 > 0

343: DFS is sub-optimal, DP is only N^2
Careful about that number has to be splitted at least two numbers
revisit

347: revisit, simple case can use PriorityQueue instead of heapq
easier to push blindly first and pop if size overflow
put qsize and get

350: sort and merge as alternative.

351: To optimize, utilize symmetric property, only needs 1, 2, 5 as start
Can use backtracking rather than iterative generating

352: first thought union find. but still work needed from individual UF element to disjoint interval
merge interval problem. Resivit my clean interval merging algorithm

366: call left/right recur and combine
Also if use degree counting. Then we need a map to store child degree and another map from child to parent.
Each time we maintain the set for the current round of the nodes which are degree zero.

368: DP, # maxset[i] stores largest divisible set using element nums[i]
Needs revisit, seems like N^3
Some local optmization can be done such as compare the length first and construct the set.
Brute force is good enough solution here

433: bfs needs visited state, can reuse the bank variable
similar to word ladder

434: like battleship

435: sort and check end boundary, keep smaller boundary

436: sorting only, boring
Update, should sort start and end separately, this will utilize two pointer

437: check at each node when recur called, check how many path at the current recur node.
Keep current path sum and the counter of all paths from root index by sum
Good

438: Sliding window
similar to min window containing all characters

439: REVISIT
Two approach: Pre-order parsing recursion versus polish notation evaluation
t/f as leaf
Another approach is to treat this as polish notation.
Reverse polish is easy, for polish we just need to traverse reversely.

Follow up: can we do bt deser using the same reverse traverse stack approach.
The serialization representation is always full (either leaf or two children)

Very careful: When overlap happens, cur_end = min(cur_end, balloon[i][1])

459: I can do it now. Prove it
If a string does not have pattern, and s+s[1:-1] has s as substring, prove by contradiction

the substring span S and S by length L1 and L2. 
Suppose s[:L1] is seg1, then s[L1:] must also start with seg1, since S[L1:] match with starting of the second copy of S
keep induction on this logic and you can find the pattern should be seg1\

KMP approach:         return p_len > 0 and len(s) % (len(s) - p_len) == 0


460: revisit, add function with priority. However PQ can takes care of frequency as internal and provide a simpler touch function interface

PQ: _add(v, p, ts), touch(v, ts), remove(v), pop(), stores key only.
Value are in valueMap

But return F if all True is correct.

Initial = 0 case

465: The solution works

526: set as the input to recur, use tuple(set) to store in memory table

527: trie with each node indexing the abbr, just be careful, not too hard

529: visited state is stored at the board itself. revisit
If it is not blank, then stop calling further DFS.
Other wise. 

If you click some e at the top row. the right bottom e shouldn't be exposed. otherwise every empty will be

When generating new one, keeping looping if clash found

539: instead of sorting, set is better, since only 1440 data points

540: good question, use binary search. get middle and check if left or right is equal,
try to get to the side with size 2n + 1

542: Two approaches
1. Multiple source BFS (Similar to shortest to gate)
# Multiple start BFS.
# To avoid using visited variable few choices
# 1. Traverse layer by layer, each layer use set
# 2. Use the distance map, and only push to queue when strictly smaller found

2. DP (revisit)
Not very obvious, very restrict to this question, not generalize to any maze problem
There is no such case it take the L shape below. So shortest distance to 1 must originate

When handling problem like no adjacent LL (like house robber).
1. Keep number of L as part of argument for the problem. If last step k takes L, then sub problem becomes

2. Populate non L at step before and reduce to P(k-2) 

553: See Q399

Store the string as well (I thought about storing the split first, but still needs one more round)

Store min and max map, each store both value and expression

OR there is math solution

554: index with most gap residing. Corner case, no gapping, careful of max(empty_set)

555: More like a brute force
We need to find the place to cut the string, so all the strings which are not cut must be taken
from the max of s and s[::-1

558: if one is leaf then easy case. Otherwise neither leaf. Do recursion on four parts
Don't forget to merge them if needed
Base case no recursion
If one is true leaf, then return the true leaf, if one is the false leaf. return the other

708: solution is not so clean for one pass , needs all corner case handling.

This is the most clean solution

710: careful when blacklist is small

Instead of walking from end to beginning, let's reverse the second leg of the path, so we are only considering two paths from the beginning to the end.
Notice after t steps, each position (r, c) we could be, is on the line r + c = t. So if we have two people at positions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), then r2 = r1 + c1 - c2. That means the variables r1, c1, c2 uniquely determine 2 people who have walked the same r1 + c1 number of steps. This sets us up for dynamic programming quite nicely.

Very mind twisting, this solution beautifully solves the two path cross problem. The same cherry 
is resolved at source.

Approach #3: Trie of Suffix Wrapped Words [Accepted]
Intuition and Algorithm

Consider the word 'apple'. For each suffix of the word, we could insert that suffix, 
followed by '#', followed by the word, all into the trie.

For example, we will insert '#apple', 'e#apple', 'le#apple', 'ple#apple', 'pple#apple', 
The addtional adding only goes up linearly
'apple#apple' into the trie. Then for a query like prefix = "ap", suffix = "le", we can find it by querying our trie for le#ap.

750: stuck in m*n*n solution

Good thing about this question is we know where the final element will be 
class Solution(object):

        ans = ma = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(arr):
            ma = max(ma, x)
            if ma == i: ans += 1
        return ans

if bigger value keep seen, extend the right cap. 
If index resides on right cap, then increment count

768: Follow up, if we don't know where the final element will be, maybe we can sort them first
If not distinct, then we are in some trouble here

    ans, cur = 0, None
        for X, Y in zip(counted, sorted(counted)):
            cur = max(cur, X)
            if cur == Y:

3. Why we only need to convert row1 here, then row2 is automatically placed in order?
   ANS: Column count bounded. If after move row1 into right seq, where row1 is 1, then the 
   same column on row2 will be 0, thus row2 is put in place as well.
4. To put row1 in place, just calculate how many 0, 1 are out of places?

Total goes up to 2 ** H

To optimize, don't just call the recursion on two child blindly.
Do level by level iteration, BFS is better here.

800: For each coordinate find [aa, bb] range
If the coordinate is alreaday is xx format, then return [xx, xx] range (Only need to check this plane then)
At most we will check 8 points. At least one point. (4 points or 2 points)

update: can take a bold assumption that each coordinate will takes the closest xx format neighbor
and combine 3 dimension coordinates

803: a quite generaal problem, needs a reverse union find algorithm
REVISIT

The problem is about knowing information about the connected components of a graph as we cut vertices. 
But this is not an online algorithm, it needs to process all the inputs and reversely process the inputs

Get the Union state after all hits, and reversely add back the hits, the delta in the top ceiling component 
is the same as the bricks that falls down

805:
 p(A[:i], k, k * target_avg)
#         p(A[:i-1], k, k * target_avg) or p(A[:i-1], k-1, k * target_avg - A[i])
        
#         sum * n * n

809: nothing special here, keep the order of unique chars and the count of chars
ans += all(c1 >= max(c2, 3) or c1 == c2
                       for c1, c2 in zip(count, count2))

813: binary search in range of (K * min and K * max)
How to verify if a target_avg_sum is possible. 
Very difficult if target_avg_sum is float, Dp does not work here

Change idea:
seems it is good use exactly K, the more groups, the larger sum
We can start with N group and merge them to make it K groups

(A0, A1, ... A_n-1) picks two smallest and merge it so the sum is still maximum.
Then what.

Change idea: DP
Takes three parameter for subproblem
(i, j, x), split num[i:j] into x parts. We can say how to pick the last segment.
Reduce to max(p(i, j', x-1) + avg(j':j))

814: delete recursion function which returns root of tree

815: I was thinking about DP
# P(dst, b1) = min(pst(dst_1, b1), pst(dst_2, b2) + 1 ....)
But no clear problem reduction here, the above could end up with loops

shortest path, each bus routine is a complete graph with edge weight 1

Don't sort on worker, do binary search

837: probability distribution by round, if value >= K, then next round no draw for it.

We need at least K round (each round draw 1)

How to optmize locally on this idea.
We can index on the new_prob_map and only do one update per new_prob_map index

838: 9 cases if else conditions
To make the corner case cleaner, we can apply L at the begining and R at the end.

839: best approach is to use UF to check each pair if they are similar, then join it
The enumeration of all similar is suboptimal

841: DFS

843: 
Revisit

First idea is to use information theory. Use the bit which has least information (most 
evenly distributed) make a guess

Minmax algorithm (Game theory)

You guess A, if B is the target, you will get the score X.

There are multiple B for the same score.

Each A will end up with a score map with score as key and number of B.

Pick the A to min the max of the map values.

The less the better

844: followup with only extra linear space (Use two pointers and go backwards if needed)

845: Just use inner loop approach. Instead of regular increasing/decreasing inner loop,
we change it to a mountain inner loop

846: Keep count map and sorted keys of count map
For each key with count of C, 
try decrement key+1, key+2 ... key+W C, if can't return False
Then move to the next smallest key

847: Sounds like hamiltian algorithm, but more difficult than that
Hamiltian algorithm can be reduced to this problem.
The same graph, is there a hamiltian path =>
In the same graph, is the min path size N - 1. (If N-1, guarantee that there is a linear path)

Try to solve in 2**N 
State P[S][j]
shortest path ending with j, covering all the points in S.

Similar idea as Hamiltian algorithm

DP sequence
1. Can do incrementally by S size
2. By incrementing on the mask value. (a subset for sure has smaller mask)

Time complexity should be 2**N * N**2

849: Like domino problem, extracting all 1 indexes into separate array is cleaner
Don't put people at first and last index, treat corner case specially

850: I thought calculate overlapping area covered by all rectangles. Then easy,
just Take A ^ B and then (A ^ B) ^ C

The union can be done using inclusion-exclusion alglrithom

There will 2**n overlappings to calculate. Too much

851: DFS with memory table
dfs(root) returns quitest richer people than root
Check all dfs(nei) and itself (can be equally rich)

853: BF,
go second by second. Each round, we iterate backwards on the array, to get the position for the
car in the next second. (take min(next_car_next_round, cur_car_this_round + speed))
Each round, check how many fleets captured at desitination (still move on after crossing destination)

Optimize:
Look at cars on your right, what is the first car on your right named A (closest to you) that you are doomed
to catch up with. Then all cars between you and A will collapose into A. 

However, A will bump into another car which is possible, only increment the counter when you find a car
which bumps into no car.

Your time to target is dis/v, find the first car on your right with >= of this value

You can avoid floating point caluculation

N** 2 trivial

Subproblem, find the closest value (closest on index) on right which is larger/smaller than you

a stack problem??

You can sort tuple of (dis/v, idx) (to avoid float value, use customized lambda function)
Go right 


position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
sort by position
[0, 3, 5, 8, 10], speed = [1, 3, 1, 4, 2]
time = [12, 3, 7, 1, 1]

C[0] = none
C[1] = 2
C[2] = none
C[3] = 4
C[4] = none

854: Sounds difficult when there is duplicates
Method 1: For each char in A which is wrong in its position, swap the first correct char
in A to its place.

A: baa
B can be aab or aba, Which a to swap is tricky.

Revisit 465 account balancing problem

Method 2, BFS with each transformed whole string as state, also need to know what is next char to check
in each state. 

1. Each level will have the same i (can be proved by induction)
2. Still needs visited state storage
For example case of aacc and ccaa
First level: caac caca
Second level: ccaa ccaa

855: priority queue
key is (s, t) and priority is the length
Seat is to search the highest priority, pop it and insert two sub intervals
Leave needs to find the interval affected and merge the interval
We need another treeset to handle the ceiling and flooring

857: P(N, K) problem
Case 1: Don't pick N-1
Case 2: Pick N-1 and pay N-1 base salary, problem reduced to find the min quality sum among K-1 in N-1 
Case 3: Pick N-1 and pay prevailing salary (if possible) reduced to P(N-1,K-1)

Can further optimize using HEAP and greedy, We can determine between 2 and 3 beforehand

861: First the sequence of toggling row or column does not matter. 
For each cell, it is if the row and if the column it belongs get toggled.

Toggle all row to start with 1, then toggle each column to maximize the count of 1 on each col

862: Similar to 220?
Regular sliding window with two pointers does not work.

-100, 1, 2, 3, 4, -20, 5, 6, ...14 and K = 8
will need to go to 14 so that -100 can be popped. Then we still did not capture 1, 2, 3, 4
When right pointer go to j, -100 needs to be popped.

This kind of question when moving left pointer does not gurantee a direction.

Increasing stack (accu sum with smaller and larger index should pop things out)

863: Find target and mark depth of target and set of nodes on the path to the target.
Do pre-order traversal for all nodes and keep updating last (deepest) node in the path which is also 
on the path towards the target.

864: Brute force (Dijkstra) + permutation

Pre-calculate all pairs distances and then do permutations

Each node is represented by (key_state and location_of_interest)
distance are all precomputed.

866: Important is how to generate palindrome in order
generate half in length level
123 will generate 12321 and 123321

870: Easy to notice that the sequence of B is not important

871: First thought, similar to frog jump stone problem. Each state is marked as (station_i, fuel)
If this is possible to reach station_i with fuel ending in tank

To convert it slightly. Use max_fuel[i] to store max_fuel we can have at station i

But this only solve the problem of T/F, not minimum step to reach destination

See solution

Let's determine dp[i], the farthest location we can get to using EXACTLY i refueling stops. 
This is motivated by the fact that we want the smallest i for which dp[i] >= target.

we know dp[i] = K, how to get dp[i+1], we can stop one more top between [0, K]
But the problem we need to make sure that stop is not stopped before in dp[i]

The real nature of the problem is P(i, j) which is max distance by stopping i times
using stations S[:j], what is the max distance.

P(i, j)  

if P(i-1, j-1) >= stations[j], then P(i, j) can be max with P(i-1, j-1) + capacity[j]

N^2 states and each state only constant operation

To clean up the code, we keep the dp vector and update the vector with help of each station

APP2:
Greedy with retrospective. 

When driving past a gas station, let's remember the amount of fuel it contained. We don't need to decide yet whether to fuel up here or not - for example, there could be a bigger gas station up ahead that we would rather refuel at.

When we run out of fuel before reaching the next station, we'll retroactively fuel up: greedily choosing the largest gas stations first.

This is guaranteed to succeed because we drive the largest distance possible before each refueling stop, and therefore have the largest choice of gas stations to (retroactively) stop at.

887: P(K, D) using K eggs to verify D candidates
Base case K = 1, then return D (verify from low to high)
Or D <= 2, having more eggs does not help
Otherwise, split D into half and try one egg at the half.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and K eggs

Where do we try 
If we try at 2, 
2 breaks, sub problem is P(K-1, 1)
2 does not, sub problem is P(K, 2)

If we try at 3,
we have a much worse problem which is P(K-1, 2), worst than both problem above.
So for even we should drop at the smaller middle

Above is wrong, the greedy assumption that the split always work is wrong. 
We should seach for split

0, 1, 2 ... N with K egges

drop at X
X breaks: P(K-1, X-1)
X doesn't: P(K, N - X)

How to find X is the optimization focus

889: Unique very important character here
recur(i1, i2) where i1 and i2 are pointers on pre-order and post-order
return root node and new pointer (or pointer shift)
Base case is where pre_order[i1] == post_order[i2]
Root [L] [R]
[L] [R] Root
If [R] is empty, then this approach can get confused

INSTEAD, input i1, j1, i2, j2
Use pre[i1+1] to find the split of left/right tree

890: same as 205

892: check neighbor height

895: 
Very good question
heap with [cnt, last_ts, val, status]
Map of value to list of ts
1. push will append to the list of ts
remove one from heap (mark status as -1) and push new one into heap

2. pop will pop from heap and then use the val to locate the list of ts and pop the last ts

Problem is that there can be too many tombstones

Can we optimize like the incr/decr 1 data structure
DDL with (idx, ts, val)
idx is the index of the same value inserted
ts is global timestamp inserted.

We also need the anchor for first element in each segments with the same idx

One map mapping value to list of nodes in DDL.
push will append to the list and based on the previous last element in the list, 
we can find the new insertion point in DDL

3. Stack of stacks 
This question is a little easier than all one operations, since we don't need to decrement the value by 1
Basically a simplied version of approach two removing the anchor
stack[f] will never become empty until stack[f+1] is empty


898: OR of subarray is similar to sum of subarray
OR(A[i:j]) = OR(A[:j]) | OR(A[:i])

N^2 is trivial

When iterating at i, we can keep a set of all accum OR seen before i,
Since there are at most 2^32 such values, this solution is not N^2, it
is N * W

(The solution suggest it is N * logW, maybe it is right, needs to prove)

899: Math problem , if k = 1 only rotation, K > 1, then any permutation is possible

xxxxxx[ba]
