For dup elements (second or after), only insert after the new subset you got from last round (up to last number)
For other numbers, insert into any subset in any round 
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/discuss/30137/Simple-iterative-solution
[1, 2, 2]
start with [[]]
after 1:   [[], [1]]
after 2:   [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]
after 2:   this 2 is special, it should only add to the last round newly added subsets
           only [2] and [1, 2] can be extended
           [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 2, 2]]
The starting j is zero if cur number is different from previous

092: smart rotating, for [2, 5] is to revert, 1 is the anchor. Everytime takes the new last element to insert right after the anchor.
This keeps the LL in good form

153: end condition is num[li] <= num[hi], which means it is sorted already
hi = mid is ok, but li = mid might cause inf loop

If two value diff > t, then it can never be the same bucket.

REVISIT, Many adjacent value gap problem can be solved this way using pigeon hole with good gap

If does, we will end up something like -4 + 5 which is wrong

Also, the logic of starting from mid element to split may not be right. How to prove??

Don't set the tone using the first two elements, not guaranteed.
Special case if the stack has only one element or zero.
First element guaranteed in the final result.

377: Different from coin change. Careful
Take the inside loop out is not correct.
Outside loop: target value,

REVISIT!!!

Memory table is only one-d array.
To know O(target), we need to put differnet coin at last step,
convert to sub problems of O(target-c1), O(target-c2) .....

More like permutation. Combination is ordered permutation

Difference:
1. Permutation: when take coin k, the remaining can take whatever
2. Combination, when take coin k, the remaining can only take coin [1, k), otherwise there will be double counting.

378: Two counters, LT and LE

379: available set
All solution seems to favor loading large data structure during constructor call. Then all operations will be o(1)
Such as available set
bit array for each number
Available set make sense when most numbers are already taken. Otherwise the used set make sense

Another idea, if recycled number is preferred, can keep a local cache of recycled.

417: Multiple source DFS (call DFS for each source) seems OK, can also use BFS. Seems no need for multiple source BFS
DFS we mark only once and if already marked, stop DFS.
Can we do:
DFS can also be optimized by call only on lowest point on each edge.
NO, WE CAN'T. there can be small valley where cannot connect to lowest point

418: revisit, main.py is the best solution, using the one pointer and mod l to get mapped into the concat string
i is cursor on reperated string. i increment by n each time. if i lands at the end of the word, that means
we can store the next space free (n slots stores all the words plus one space). We incre i by 1 and start
next line with the beginning of next string.

Very tricky problem

422: boring question. Shape of matrix not necessarily square 

424: Follow up very tricky
The above code uses localMaxFreq to keep track the maximum frequency of each current window. However, if we think carefully, we can find that if localMaxFreq of window A >= localMaxFreq of window B, then the A window must have longer length than the B window, this is because since both window A and window B hold this property (the length of the window) - (the maximum frequency of the character in this window) > k, and if localMaxFreq of window A >= localMaxFreq of window B, then (the length of the window A) >= (the length of the window B) by simple algebra .

Hence, we only need to keep track of a globalMaxFreq to record the globally maximum frequency of each window what has been seen so far.

s1 = "bacba" where first b will be skipped

OR:
Left/Right window optimal solution. Imagine each seg of 1, two 0 have a 0 length 1 segment between them
So two zeroes will flush both left and right window.
Easier to think about the sub problem of ending with each index rather than connecting left and right
At index i, right window is the continous 1 starting from i and go left until you hit zero
Left window is from that zero and go further left and how many 1 can you collect
